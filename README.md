Credit card fraud detection employs real-time transaction monitoring, machine learning algorithms, and behavioral analysis to identify and prevent unauthorized transactions. Advanced systems consider factors like transaction patterns, geographical data, and biometric authentication, establishing baselines for normal behavior and flagging anomalies. Velocity checks, IP address tracking, and collaborative information sharing enhance detection capabilities. Rule-based systems and real-time alerts trigger investigations into suspicious activities. The goal is to swiftly and accurately identify fraudulent transactions, protecting both cardholders and financial institutions from potential financial losses and maintaining the overall security of the financial ecosystem.
